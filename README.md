# host-with-the-most

This is a simple fileserver with a React frontend that automatically formats JavaScript snippets and is easy to self-host

## Motivation

It was my friend Kevin's idea

## Installation

Build the frontend: `cd frontend && yarn build`

Go back to the project root and run the backend: `node server.js`

## Roadmap

- Dockerise the app to make it easier to self-host
- Create a proper UI
- Error handling in the backend
- Deploy using something other than Now, don't use the `tmp` folder for files
- Proper monorepo structure
- Think of a better name
